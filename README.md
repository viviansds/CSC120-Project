Reflection

Vivian: I really enjoyed building this game because we can be very creative when it comes to designing the clues. I feel very accomplished everytime I play the game because we literally build it from scratch. In our project, we use inheritance to build our three rooms. While different rooms have different methods for the clues, the parent class method unlock() is convenient to help unlock all three rooms. Although we did anticipate that there will be alot of if-else statements in the beginning phase, our main Gameloop class still got very long. When I asked the TA about how to improve it, she didn’t find a better way either. The only possible change is to pull out the generic and repetitive user input prompt as its own method so we don’t have to copy that code each time. Overall, this project allows me to bring all the things we learn in this class together and see it in action.

Yujie: I never had the experience of designing an object-oriented project before, and this project really gave me more insights into object oriented programming. When we tried to come up with our ideas about the escape room, instead of thinking in a sequential way, we needed to think about which object this action belongs to, and how to call the method in our Gameloop. This way of thinking is very new to me and I feel like I adapted to an object-oriented way of thinking better through working on this project. Although we tried our best to put methods into different classes, our program was still not object-oriented enough because we do have sequential actions that need the user to follow the instructions. This is something we can potentially improve but also very hard to avoid in an escape room design because users could only have the permission to go to the next room after they found the key or passcode. I also had a great experience of working with my group members. We spend a lot of time brainstorming, writing codes, decoding and I really learned a lot from my group members. 

Zhirou: We divide the work by each group member building one of the subclasses and collaboratively build the main Gameloop class together. We start with how to find the key in a room and how to guide the user to go over each step. Then we designed the room and tried to anticipate what actions are needed for the character. After that, we build the character class and the main class to connect the storyline together. I learned how to use the scanner efficiently and have a more comprehensive understanding of the while loop. If we have unlimited time, I hope we can learn how to build a user interface with images.  Meanwhile, we also came through many problems like too many if-else statements and having other loops contained in a loop etc. I realized some of these problems from the feedback of our professor and other classmates. If I could go back in time and give my past self some advice about this project, I would say doing it step by step. The project will start small and gradually elaborate during the process. Our collaboration and team dynamics make our progress efficient and productive. Our ideas let the game make more sense. We spent a lot of time trying to figure it out and asked help from our professor and TAs to end up with the codes we have for now. I learned how to think critically about our code and how to improve the code. This experience makes me become more interested in programming and want to explore it in-depth. Our escape room project gives me an opportunity to review what we have learned in the past semester.
